## Project Overview

Cura Education aims to assist teachers by providing automatically generated exemplar answers for educational tasks. These answers serve as benchmarks to improve the efficiency and consistency of grading. This project uses a fine-tuned version of OpenAI's GPT-4o model, specifically trained on provided educational data, to generate exemplar answers that align with task rubrics and criteria.

### Core Objectives
1. Integrate with the OpenAI API to fine-tune a language model for generating exemplar answers.
2. Evaluate generated answers against rubrics and sample training data.
3. Develop an evaluation system to assess the quality of generated answers.
